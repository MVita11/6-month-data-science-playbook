# 6-Month Data Science Playbook

A structured, project-driven journey to become a Data Scientist, inspired by the [AI and Data Scientist Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist).

## Overview

This repository tracks my 6-month learning plan combining:
- Core concepts in Math, Stats, and Programming
- Hands-on projects across Machine Learning and Data Engineering
- Coding challenges and case studies
- Deployment and MLOps practices

## üóì Monthly Focus

| Month | Focus                                  |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| 1     | Python, Git, Linear Algebra, EDA       |
| 2     | Statistics, Hypothesis Testing, SQL    |
| 3     | Supervised ML, Regression, Classification |
| 4     | Advanced ML, Ensembling, Deep Learning |
| 5     | Time Series, Forecasting, NLP Basics   |
| 6     | MLOps, Deployment, Real-World Projects |
